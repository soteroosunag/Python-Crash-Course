If I had infinite programming skills and could build anything I wanted, I would build all sorts of things. Here are my top 5:
1. AI-powered investment manager and trading bot
2. Sports analytics platform and algorithmic betting system
3. AI-powered personal assistant with IoT (Basically Jarvis)
4. Recommendation system for movies, books, and music (maybe similar to the way Tinder works for training?)
5. Personal website (I'd like to have a website that I can use to showcase my projects and skills)
